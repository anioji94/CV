## Aniruddh Ojha

I'm a Maker's Graduate with a background in Science Communication, Motion Design and Biochemistry. In the past few months, I've transitioned from being a freelance Motion Design and Videographer into a Full Stack software developer thanks to Maker's Academy. My passion for tech stems from my constant need to create new things!

I was first interested in the world of software development while writing small little scripts in Adobe After Effects (a program I use to make motion graphics and 2D animation). It was so useful to automate this and that in order to make my workflow more efficient. 

Now that I've graduated from Maker's with a few projects under my belt, I'd really like to keep that momentum going by starting a couple small projects which I can tinker with. My aim as a graduate is to consolidate my knowledge and understanding so that I can be a reliable new recruit at a tech firm!

## Experience

#### Project Management

- Through Maker's Academy, I have been involved with managing Projects with a randomly selected group of teammates. We would be set a task which needs to be completed within a few days. Given our short timeframe, it was imperative that we learn a new programming framework and make something presentable in that short timeframe.
- The trick was to spend a couple days at the beginning planning our goals and making them acheivable without compromising quality. Sticking to a few goals and aiming to make a polished final draft is key.

#### Self Learning

Descriptive paragraph of how capable you are at this skill and, if relevant, how it has developed.

As a Motion Designer and Videographer without a formal background in animation, I had to pick up a lot of information myself. I taught myself 2D motion design on After Effects using Youtube tutorials, Skillshare courses and through lots of Googling. Fuelled by my desire to understand and learn, I used resources available to me in order to complete projects and make new things. Throughout the Pandemic, I've been running webinars using OBS, a software that I hadn't used previously. 

- I ran several Webinars for various companies to help them reach a wider audeince
- I contributed to the growth of [charities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_c5xEX55CWA&ab_channel=Parkinson%27sUK) and patient [advocacy groups](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJIyQezEMb4&ab_channel=OFFICIALParkinson%27sConcierge) through webinars and online video content.

- In my spare time, I play a lot (A LOT) of guitar and bass. I absolutely love learning new songs and practicing. I play in a couple bands and have performed live with them both many times (before this pandemic of course!)
- I also perform a little comedy from time to time. I enjoy the art of creating a show and presenting it to the audience. Hopefully the audience enjoys it too!
- When I'm not at my desk working, I love just going for a long walk with a funny podcast or a solid album on Spotify.
